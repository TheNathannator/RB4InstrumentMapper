Both guitars and drums are supported through an Xbox One wireless receiver.

## Software Requirements

- Windows 10 64-bit
- [WinPCap](https://www.winpcap.org/install/default.htm)
- [USBPCap](https://desowin.org/usbpcap/)
- [ViGEmBus](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus/releases/latest) or [vJoy](https://github.com/jshafer817/vJoy/releases/latest)

## Hardware Notes

Jaguar guitars require a firmware update in order to connect to the receiver.

- [Firmware installer backup](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DQxkkbBfi-UOqdX6vp5TaX6F2N2OBDra/view?usp=drivesdk)

RB4 drums made by PDP don't seem to work, they turn off after syncing to the receiver. You may be able to get them to connect with these steps:

- Go to Windows settings > `Devices` > `Bluetooth & other devices`
- Click `Add Bluetooth or other device` and pick the `Everything else` option.

## Installation

1. Install [WinPCap](https://www.winpcap.org/install/default.htm).
   - Do not install Npcap, as it doesn't seem to work with Xbox One receivers.
2. Install [USBPCap](https://desowin.org/usbpcap/).
3. Install [ViGEmBus](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus/releases/latest) (recommended) or [vJoy](https://github.com/jshafer817/vJoy/releases/latest).
   - If you installed vJoy, configure it:
     1. Open your Start menu, find the `vJoy` folder, and open the `Configure vJoy` program inside it.
     2. Configure devices 1, 2, and 3 with these settings:
        - Number of Buttons: 16
        - POV Hat Switch: Continuous, POVs: 1
        - Axes: `X`, `Y`, `Z`
     3. Click Apply.<!-- Backslash for a forced hard line break -->\

   - If you installed ViGEmBus, there's no configuration required. Outputs for guitars and drums will match that of their Xbox 360 counterparts.
4. Restart your PC.
5. Download the latest release from the [Releases tab](https://github.com/ferzkopp/RB4InstrumentMapper/releases/latest) and install it.

## Usage

1. Configure the selected Pcap device:
   - Click the `Auto-Detect Pcap` button and follow its instructions.
   - If that doesn't work, then if you installed WinPcap, try installing Npcap instead, or vice versa.
2. Select either vJoy or ViGEmBus in the Controller Type dropdown.
3. Connect your instruments if you haven't yet.
4. Click the Start button. Devices will be detected automatically.
5. Map the controls for each instrument in Clone Hero:
   1. Press Space on the main menu.
   2. Click the Assign Controller button and press a button on the instrument for it to be assigned.
   3. Click the slots in the Controller column to map each of the controls.
   4. Repeat for each connected device.
   5. Click `Done`.

Selections are saved and should persist across program sessions.

## Packet Logs

RB4InstrumentMapper is capable of logging packets to a file for debugging purposes. To do so, enable both the `Show Packets (for debugging)` and `Log packets to file` checkboxes, then hit Start. Packet logs get saved to a `RB4InstrumentMapper` > `PacketLogs` folder inside your Documents folder. Make sure to include it when getting help or creating an issue report for packet parsing issues.

Note that these settings are meant for debugging purposes only, leaving them enabled can reduce the performance of the program somewhat.

## Error Logs

In the case that the program crashes, an error log is saved to a `RB4InstrumentMapper` > `Logs` folder inside your Documents folder. Make sure to include it when getting help or creating an issue report for the crash.
